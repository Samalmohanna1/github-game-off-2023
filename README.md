## About Rat's Reckoning

### Game Off 2023 - Theme is Scale
Rat's Reckoning, a chapter from Strategic Cheeseboard: A Leader Exposed saga, is a short and fun point-and-click game that packs a punch. Come see the scale of corporate greed, and get a few punches in.

This is my submission to Github's Game Off 2023. Theme and rules can be found here: [https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023)
